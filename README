               Guidelines for iist.cls LaTeX Template 
              ----------------------------------------
        https://github.com/kunalbahuguna/IISc_Document_Template


The LaTeX template 'iisc.cls' is developed for creating reports/theses
for undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students with minimal effort in
scripting.
Based on:
IIST Thesis Template (https://github.com/4sarathbabu/IISTThesis)

1. How to Start?
----------------

The template is defined in LaTeX class file 'iisc.cls' included in 
the folder. The main LaTeX source file that needs to be 
built/compiled is 'iisc_template.tex'. At the first line of 'iisc_template.tex', the 
document class is mentioned as the custom style 'iisc'. Options to 
the document class vary depending on your degree and the type of 
report that you are writing. Set the type using
  \documentclass[degree,document type,twoside]{iisc} 

The variations are as follows:
  degree: B. Sc., B. Tech, M. Tech, M. Tech (Research), M. S., Ph. D.
  document type: internship, project, synopsis, thesis
Examples:
  M.Tech Project: \documentclass[mtech,report,twoside]{iisc}  
  Ph.D. Thesis: \documentclass[phd,thesis,twoside]{iisc}        

Notes:

 (a) If you want to create single sided report, remove the option
     'twoside' from the above-mentioned line.

 (b) The template uses Times as the default font. Instead, if you want
     to use default LaTeX font, i.e., Computer Modern, comment the
     line '\usepackage{times}' in 'iisc_template.tex'.


2. Specifying Credentials of the Report/Thesis
----------------------------------------------

Provisions for specifying the report/thesis credentials are made
simple that you need to mention them only once in the file
'iisc_template.tex'. Credentials will be automatically taken to the initial
pages of the document, such as Title Page, Certificate, Declaration,
and Acknowledgements, wherever required.  The commands for providing
the report credentials are as follows:

  Document Title: \title{}
  Author: \author{}
  Author ID: \studentid{}
  Project/Thesis Advisor: \advisor{}
  Specialization: \specialization{}
  Department: \department{}
  Discipline: \discipline{}
  Date: \date{}  


3. Creating Initial Pages of the Report/Thesis
----------------------------------------------

The initial pages of the report/thesis include Title Page,
Certificate, Declaration, Dedication, and Acknowledgements. The
content of these pages will be filled automatically with the
credentials provided as described in Section 2. If you want to edit
the contents in any of the initial pages (For example, editing the
designation of Head of the Department or Supervisor in certificate
page, content for dedication and acknowledgement), you need to edit
the appropriate TeX source. The source files corresponding to the
initial pages are as follows:

  Certificate: 'certificate.tex'
  Declaration: 'declaration.tex'
  Dedication: 'dedication.tex'
  Acknowledgements: 'acknowledgements.tex'
  Abstract: 'abstract.tex'
  Abbreviations: 'abbreviations.tex'
  Nomenclature: 'nomenclature.tex'
  Publications: 'publications.tex'
	
The pages Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables, and List
of Algorithms are automatically generated from the contents of the
report/thesis.

Note: Since 'PhD synopsis' does not require some of the initial pages,
you can comment the lines \makecertificate, \makedeclaration,
\makededication, \makeacknowledgements, \makelistoffigures,
\makelistoftables, and \makelistofalgorithms in 'iisc_template.tex'.
Please DO NOT comment the line \makechaptersettings.


4. Addition of Chapters, Appendices, and List of Publications
-------------------------------------------------------------

In order to include chapters, it is recommended to organize chapters
into different TeX files. For example, 'chapter1.tex', 'chapter2.tex',
'chapter3.tex', and so on (As an example, three chapters are included
in this template). You can include each chapter in the report using
the command '\input'. For example, 'chapter1.tex' can be included
using the command

			\input{chapter1}
				
in the file 'iisc_template.tex'. Similar to chapters, appendices are also
included as separate chapters. As an example two appendices 'Appendix
A' and 'Appendix B' are included with respective source files in
'appendixA.tex' and 'appendixB.tex', respectively. List of
publications is also added as a chapter with TeX source in
'publications.tex'.

For PhD synopsis: Since PhD synopsis does not contain chapters, you
can include the entire content in 'chapter1.tex' and include it in
'iisc_template.tex'. Also, remove the first line '\chapter{...}' from
'chapter1.tex'.


5. Writing Theorems, Proofs, Lemmas, Definitions, Remarks,
-----------------------------------------------------------
Assumptions, and Propositions
------------------------------

For writing different math environments such as theorems and proofs
the following environments are defined.

    Theorem     :    \begin{theorem} ... \end{theorem}
    Proof       :    \begin{proof} ... \end{proof}             
    Lemma       :    \begin{lemma} ... \end{lemma}
    Corollary	:    \begin{corollary} ... \end{corollary}
    Proposition :    \begin{proposition} ... \end{proposition}
    Conjecture	:    \begin{conjecture} ... \end{conjecture}
    Definition  :    \begin{definition} ... \end{definition}
    Condition	:    \begin{condition} ... \end{condition}
    Assumption  :    \begin{assumption} ... \end{assumption}
    Example	:    \begin{example} ... \end{example}
    Problem	:    \begin{problem} ... \end{problem}
    Remark     	:    \begin{remark} ... \end{remark}
    Claim	:    \begin{claim}  ... \end{claim}
    Note	:    \begin{note} ... \end{note}


6. Addition of Bibliography
---------------------------

Bibliographies can be added using BibTeX tool with the appropriate 
citation style. A separate file named 'iisc_template.bib' is provided to 
specify the BibTeX entries of the citations present in the 
report/thesis. In 'iisc_template.tex', bibliographies can be included using 
the following commands

			\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}
			\bibliography{iisc_template}
				
In the template, the bibliography style of IEEE is used. However, you
can replace the style IEEEtran with other styles such as unsrt, plain,
and apa.


7. Building the LaTeX Source
----------------------------

If you have installed the tool 'latexmk', just build 'iisc_template.tex' 
using latexmk. Otherwise, you need to follow the default LaTeX 
building process using the following steps:

1. Build iisc_template.tex using pdflatex
2. Build iisc_template.bib using bibtex
3. Build iisc_template.tex using pdflatex
4. Build iisc_template.tex using pdflatex
